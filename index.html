        <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          <b>Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam</b>, fondly known as the "Missile Man of India,"
          was one of the most revered scientists, educators, and statesmen of
          modern India. Born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he
          hailed from a modest family. Despite financial challenges, his
          curiosity and determination drove him to excel academically, earning
          a degree in aerospace engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kalam began his illustrious career at the Defence Research and
          Development Organisation (DRDO) and later joined the Indian Space
          Research Organisation (ISRO), where he played a pivotal role in the
          development of India’s first satellite launch vehicle, SLV-III, which
          successfully deployed the Rohini satellite into orbit. His
          significant contributions to India’s defense sector include leading
          the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme, which earned him
          national acclaim.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Kalam also served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to
          2007, where he became widely admired as the "People's President" for
          his humility, vision, and dedication to inspiring youth. Known for
          his simplicity and passion for education, he authored several books,
          including <em>Wings of Fire</em>, which continues to motivate
          millions. Even in his final moments on July 27, 2015, he was
          delivering a lecture to students. His life remains a beacon of
          inspiration for generations to dream big and serve the nation.
